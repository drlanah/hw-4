Code Quiz

The quiz was created using HTMl, Javascript, and CSS.

There is a "Start Quiz" button, which initiates a four question quiz, as well as a 30 second countdown timer.

After a user selects an answer, a display will state whether it is correct or not.

A final score will appear, which will display the "seconds left".

After answering the questions, the user will input their initials.

An "Add to Top Scores" button will record the user's intials and score into a list, which is retrievable in a "Top Scores" link in the navigation bar.
